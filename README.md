# Spaceship Selector

This project is an one-day coding challenge. It allows the user to use the [SWAPI Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation) to select star ships to be displayed in a table.

The project uses [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for the front library and [React MobX](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html) for state management.

The project allows for absolute imports, as per in jsconfig.json.
